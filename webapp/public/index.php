    <h2>Welcome to the UW HusKey Manager Project!</h2>

    <p>Congratulations on getting your Docker Based web app up and running! This quarter we will be embarking on a journey to build a basic password manager application. Throughout this course, you will have the opportunity to develop, enhance, and secure an application that plays a crucial role in managing assets effectively.</p>

    <p>Our focus during this quarter will not only be on developing a password manager system but also on identifying and resolving real-world cybersecurity issues. This hands-on experience will provide you with valuable insights into securing web applications, a skill set in high demand in today's technology landscape.</p>

    <p>As we progress, you will encounter various challenges related to cybersecurity, ranging from authentication and authorization to secure data storage and transmission. These challenges are designed to simulate real-world scenarios, allowing you to apply and reinforce the concepts learned in class.</p>

    <p>Remember, security is not just a feature; it's a continuous process. By the end of this quarter, you will not only have a functional asset tracking application but also a deeper understanding of how to build and maintain secure web applications in an ever-evolving digital landscape.</p>

    <p>Best of luck, and let's make this quarter a journey of learning, exploration, and mastery!</p>
